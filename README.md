# Go Go Chuck Joke (ggcj)

## About

This is a learning project. This project uses [wails](https://wails.io/) to create a desktop app. I am using [Lit](https://lit.dev/) for front end template. Overall, this project was a lot of fun. I am looking for to see how the wails project evolves.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
